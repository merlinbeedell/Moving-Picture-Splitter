# Moving-Picture-Splitter

Ths is a simple utility script, that hopefully will become redundant when Moving Pictures get better supported by Photo applications!

A moving picture is a combined JPG + MP4 file.  It is a bit scary to think that a JPG file can contain any old rubbish after the image - suggesting it could be an ideal payload for a virus.

Anyway, this script will split the original file into the 2 parts (image and mp4).
The modified date is preserved.

You can process whole directories or individual files.  Just list the paths as final parameters.

It supports a range of other options - run it without any parameters and it will give help.

Groovy is a wrapper language over Java - so both will need to be installed.

Huge thanks to trekky12 for the hard work creating the first version (in Python).
